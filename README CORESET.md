Welcome to DataHeroes' skcoreset library.

The file you have just unzipped includes the following:
1. Under the `headers` directory, you can find the services_headers.py file describing the currently available functionality.
2. Under the `examples` directory, you can find two notebook files. Start with the cleaning_example_cifar10_coreset_vs_random.ipynb notebook, 
   which compares cleaning the CIFAR-10 dataset using the DataHeroes' skcoreset library vs. cleaning the dataset randomly. 
   The `cleaning_example_cifar10_with_labeling_utility.ipynb` notebook uses the same dataset, just provides a simple utility, 
   which allows you to display the pictures and correct their labels.
3. Under the `loaders` directory, you can find two files demonstrating how to extract the features from the CIFAR-10 dataset using either PyTorch or TensorFlow+Keras.
4. Alternatively to running one of the loaders, you can download the example dataset from our website, unzip the file and place its content as is under the `data` directory, 
   which is currently empty.

We are excited to have you try out the library and hear your feedback! 
If you have any questions, need assistance with anything or just want to provide feedback, please email us at **support@dataheroes.ai**.
